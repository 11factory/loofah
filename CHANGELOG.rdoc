== 0.4 (unreleased)

Enhancements:

  * Refactored scrubber code to live in nice Scrubber classes, which

    implement their own filters.
  * :nofollow scrubber (thanks Luke Melia!)

Bug fixes:

* Scrubbed Documents properly render html, head and body tags when serialized.

Enhancements:

* New ActiveRecord extension `xss_foliate`, a drop-in replacement for xss_terminate[http://github.com/look/xss_terminate/tree/master].

* Official support (and test coverage) for Rails versions 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 and 1.2.

Deprecations:

* The methods strip_tags, whitewash, whitewash_document, sanitize, and

  details on the equivalent calls with the post-0.2 API.
